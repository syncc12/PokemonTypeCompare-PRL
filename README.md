## Purpose:<br>
This project allows Pokemon fans to create their very own Pokemon party.  Whether you're a casual fan who just wants to see what their party will look like, or are a competitive fan who wants to check and balance their party before a match, this application is the perfect tool for you.

## Overview:<br>
This project takes advantage of JavaScript and JQuery to create a semi-dynamic interface.  First displaying a list of all available Pokemon to choose from along side a space reserved for your party.  After a Pokemon is selected, a new list will appear, this one displaying a list of all available moves for that particular Pokemon.  Up to four moves may be chosen for each Pokemon.  When all moves have been selected and the Pokemon is ready to be added to the party, simply selecte the "Add To Party" button.  The page will return to displaying the same things it did at the very beginning, except now one of the spots in the section reserved for your party will be filled with the Pokemon that was just chosen.  This process may be repeated until as many as six Pokemon are added to your party. Was a Pokemon added to your party by mistake?  No problem!  Simply click on the Pokemon in your party and it will be removed, and a new Pokemon can be added in its place.
